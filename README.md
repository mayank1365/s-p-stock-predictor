## Future Enhancements

There are several potential directions to expand and refine the capabilities of this stock price prediction model:  

- **Incorporate Global Indices**:  
  By integrating data from multiple global stock indices that open before the U.S. market, such as Asian and European markets, the model could better capture pre-market trends. Analyzing how these indices influence the S&P 500 stock prices would provide valuable context for more accurate predictions.

- **Macroeconomic Indicators**:  
  Including factors like inflation rates, GDP growth, and unemployment rates could offer insights into the broader economic landscape. These indicators often have significant impacts on market movements and can improve the robustness of the predictions.

- **Sector-Wise Performance Analysis**:  
  Analyzing how individual sectors (e.g., technology, healthcare, finance) are performing within the U.S. economy would allow the model to account for sector-specific trends. This could be particularly useful during times of sectoral booms or downturns.

- **Sentiment Analysis**:  
  Leveraging sentiment analysis from financial news, earnings reports, and social media platforms could help the model predict stock price movements based on public and market sentiment.

- **Real-Time Data Integration**:  
  Enhancing the model to include real-time stock price updates and live market data would enable dynamic predictions that adapt to current market conditions.
